## R Interface to the ProteomeXchange Repository

Thre `rpx` package is a simple interface to proteomics data submitted
to the ProteomeXchange consortium. See the official Bioconductor
[page](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rpx.html),
and in particular the
[vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/rpx/inst/doc/rpx.pdf)
for details.


### TODO/notes

- maybe also provide interface to the PRIDE repo
- is it possibly to get a list of all valid PX ids?
